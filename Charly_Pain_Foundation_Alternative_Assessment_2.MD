1.1: Relational Database Management system

1.2: If trying to use a print statement without quotation marks, a ‘Syntax Error’ is given, and indicates which line the error occurred on.

1.2: Git is a free tool that developers can use for code development management, and they can track changes to code from multiple developers.

1.3: A compound key

1.5: API stands for Application programming interface and an example of this is the YouTube API, and developers can use it to help the function of tasks such as uploading videos etc.

1.6: Two responsibilities developers have include, writing code and testing that code.

1.7: Somethings to take into consideration are 
	1. what are the paymet options going to be like and taking payments, how to stop fraud etc
        2. the users experience and if it is an easy shopping site to use, e.g. Zara website is hard to navigate so would make sure this wasn't the case
	3. Technical issues, like if too many people are on the website

1.8: An error would be called when a denominator = 0, due to anything being * with 0 = 0 and would raise a nodivisionerror 
    We could solve this by printing an error message e.g "no percentage" or "none" etc.

1.9: AGILE! Agile is a much more flexible approach and lets your team adapt to new changes since you work on small sections at a time. 
	Beacuse an agile work style focuses on delivering work in small sections, it means the team can get feedback and improve/change things much quicker.

1.10: SDLC = Software Development Lifestyle     
	1. Research = This invloves a lot of research into what requirements are needed for the applications, and making a plan on how to get this done.
	2. Planning = making a plan on how to get from concept to working code. 
	3. Product design = What the porduct will look like
	4. Building Code = This is where the code is written and make sure it meets the requirements gathered from the research stage
	5. Testing the code = Testing the code written to make sure it works 
	6. Working code for use = Once the testing is complete and design etc, this stage means the software can be used.
